\section{Prior and Related Work}\label{sec:related-\myInitials}

% This is space to add in discussion of \textbf{prior work} - word on the same problem or kernel that your paper assumes, and \textbf{related work} - work on the same application but using different approach or kernel, or a different but similar application..

% Prior work has focused primarily on the efficacy of the random walk methods, and not on parallelization of the algorithms.
