\section{Enhanced Scaling Results}\label{sec:enhanced-scaling-\myInitials}

% Discuss here results from the enhanced algorithm. Include software and hardware configuration, where the input graph data sets came from, and how input data set characteristics were varied. Ideally plots of performance vs BOTH problem size changes AND hardware resources are desired. Did the performance as a function of size vary as you predicted?

Forthcoming.
